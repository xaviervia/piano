Feature: `controllers` folder autoloading
  In order to make controllers development easier
  As a Piano developer
  I want to have Piano automatically loading them

Scenario: Simple setup in controllers
  Given I have a valid .controller file which 'get "/"' outputs "Hello!"
  When I run the piano server on port "4567"
  And I get to "http://localhost:4567/"
  Then I should see "Hello!"

Scenario: Files ending in other than .controller are not loaded
  Given I have an invalid extension .controller file 
  And its 'get "/"' outputs "Not for your eyes!"
  When I run the piano server on port "4567"
  And I get to "http://localhost:4567"
  Then I should not see "Not for your eyes!"
